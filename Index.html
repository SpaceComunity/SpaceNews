<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Space Time</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.
<br> In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear
 dimensions.<br> Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part 
of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">What Is Space Research Technology?

<p style="text-align:center;">Space exploration technology is anything that advances the exploration of
 space through a device, machine, or technology made to do so.
 Government-sponsored facilities for space exploration operate globally,
 such as NASA in the United States, ROSCOSMOS in Russia, China's CNSA,
 and the European Space Agency.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">What is the relative theory of space and time?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Space and time are relative (i.e., they depend on the motion of the observer
 who measures them) — and light is more fundamental than either.
 This is the basis of Einstein's theory of special relativity 
("special" refers to the restriction to uniform motion).</p>
