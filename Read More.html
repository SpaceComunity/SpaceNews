<h1 style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;">Space Time</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.
<br> In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear
 dimensions.<br> Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part 
of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.</p>

<p style="font-size:50px;text-align:center;">About Space Time Theory</p>

<p>General relativity is a physical theory about space and time and it has a 
beautiful mathematical description. According to general relativity,
 the spacetime is a 4-dimensional object that has to obey an equation, 
called the Einstein equation, which explains how the matter curves the spacetime
.</p>

<p>Space and time are relative (i.e., they depend on the motion of the observer
 who measures them) — and light is more fundamental than either.
 This is the basis of Einstein's theory of special relativity 
("special" refers to the restriction to uniform motion).</p>

<p>May 15, 2024 — Astronomers have just discovered a new Earth-sized exoplanet
 around SPECULOOS-3, an 'ultracool dwarf' star as small as Jupiter,
 twice as cold as our Sun, and located 55 light-years from Earth.</p>

<p>SpaceX is poised to launch a pioneering set of spy satellites for the
 U.S. government early Wednesday morning (May 22).


A Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to loft the NROL-146 mission for the National
Reconnaissance Office (NRO) from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base
 Monday, during a 2.5-hour window that opens at 4 a.m. EDT 
(0800 GMT; 1 a.m. local California time).


SpaceX will webcast the launch via its X account, beginning about 10 minutes 
before the window opens.</p>

<p>NASA-funded pulsed plasma rocket concept aims to send astronauts to
 Mars in 2 months. James Webb Space Telescope sees Orion Nebula in a stunning

<p>The preponderance of evidence to date, based on measurements of the rate of
 expansion and the mass density, favors a universe that will continue to expand 
indefinitely, resulting in the "Big Freeze" scenario below. However, observation
s are not conclusive, and alternative models are still possible.</p>
